RetroTector | Code | Documentation

In memmory of Prof. Jonas Blomberg, we make the RetroTector code for identifying and analyzing endogenous retroviruses available in its current form.

• RetroTector 1.0.1 | This version consists mainly of executable files (.jar|.class|.txt) containing motifs and alignments that may improve further with revision.
A compiled version can be downloaded: https://github.com/PatricJernLab/RetroTector

The Java source code behind the .jar and .class files is appended to the RetroTector package, which also includes extensive .html documentation
